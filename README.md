# Sign-up Form Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I'm flexing my knowledge of creating forms in HTML.

## Project Overview

The Sign-up Form project is a simple web form designed for users to create an account. It includes form fields for entering personal information such as first name, last name, email, phone number, password, and confirming the password. The project focuses on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing form.

## Project Features

- A background image that enhances the overall design of the page.
- A company logo and name.
- Input fields for user registration with labels and placeholders.
- Password confirmation validation to ensure the entered passwords match.
- A "Create Account" button to submit the form.
